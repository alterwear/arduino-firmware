## Basic E-Ink Setup

### Hardware
**Correct datasheet, we think**
- The working one is , which [has been discontinued.](http://www.pervasivedisplays.com/kits/ext_kit). The datasheet is "EPD Extension board_Schematic_Gerber_v05". The files are available at that link, but also uploaded to this repo.
- Pervasive Displays (e-ink manufacturer) [support](http://www.pervasivedisplays.com/contact). Definitely contact them if you have issues! They should help you with specific questions.

**Another datasheet, not sure what it is for**
- This is a screenshot of ANOTHER circuit diagram [Fig. 5-1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/spbxfzleej3tsp5/Screenshot%202018-02-21%2015.26.41.png?dl=0) from the datasheet.

### Software
#### Default (Arduino UNO and GRATIS library)
1. Download the Arduino library from Adafruit's [tutorial on how to use the e-ink display board](https://learn.adafruit.com/repaper-eink-development-board/overview) we have.
2. Once you've installed the library, the library code we want is EPD_V230_G2 --> demo_200 (should work out of the box).

#### Arduino Pro Mini
1. The Arduino Pro Mini is programmed over FTDI (3.3V I think).

#### Experimental
1. Paul Schow's github: https://github.com/paulschow/epapercard
(specifically firmware -> paul_demo_200, which is an updated, simplified version of the same library w/ "excess" parts removed.)
2. "Our" version of Paul's code: https://github.com/molecule/epapercard
3. Paul Schow's blog: https://www.paulschow.com//2016/08/epaper-business-card.html?m=1

## Basic NFC Setup on Uno

Notes: I2C communicates over 2 lines (SDA and SCLK). These both need pull-up resistors because they are "open drain".[2] According to [1], the tag click has pull-up resistors on SDA and SCLK already. Table 15[3] says the I2C address is 04h. [A good tutorial on I2C from Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c)

0. Note that the NFC cannot be connected to Tx, Rx while uploading.
1. Connect GND, 3.3V to the Arduino

EPD breakout board (green):
- Compatible with: 40+pin e-ink display (connector is zig-zag).
- Goals: Recreate it on the breadboard, then simplify if possible, then create an SMD version.

Teensy e-paper adapter board (red): https://hackaday.io/project/13327-teensy-e-paper-adapter-board
- Original crowdsource campaign: https://www.crowdsupply.com/soniktech/e-paper-shield-kit
- Library code and example: https://github.com/jarek319/EPD215
- Compatible with: 20+-pin e-ink displays (connector is straight).
- Goals: Get it working (library code freezes and we don't know why), recreate and build our own.
